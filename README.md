# Fastest-sorting-algorithm-finder

This project i developed to find the best sorting algorithm for different different type of array dataset

In this project you can give input in the form of array 

After that program will test the given data on all six sorting algorithm mentioned below and calculate the time taken by that algorithm to produce the result:
-Bubble sort
-Selection sort
-Inserstion sort
-Heap sort
-Merge sort 
-quick sort

In the output section it will give:
-Time taken by all six algorithm individualy.
-Fastest algorithm for that data set among all six algorithms.

Module used:
-Time module of python to claculate the time
-Random module of python to take random data set as an input for testing

Sorting algorithms are used in various real-life applications and industries to optimize data processing, improve efficiency, and enhance user experiences. Here are some real-life use cases of sorting algorithms:

E-Commerce and Retail:

-Product Recommendations: Sorting algorithms are used to recommend products to customers based on their preferences and browsing history.
-Product Listings: Online stores use sorting to display products in search results or category pages, often based on factors like relevance, price, or customer ratings.

Search Engines:

-Search Results: Sorting algorithms help rank search results based on relevance, user behavior, and other factors to provide users with the most useful information quickly.

Social Media:

-News Feeds: Social media platforms use sorting to display posts from friends or accounts followed by a user in a chronological or algorithmically determined order.
Financial Services:

Stock Market Data: Sorting algorithms are used to process and display stock prices and market data in real-time, helping traders make informed decisions.

Healthcare:

-Patient Data: Sorting patient records by various criteria (e.g., age, medical condition, urgency) aids healthcare professionals in providing timely and accurate care.

Transportation and Logistics:

-Route Optimization: Sorting algorithms help optimize delivery routes, saving time and fuel in logistics and transportation operations.
Library and Information Systems:

-Book Catalogs: Sorting is used in library catalogs and online databases to organize books and other resources for easy retrieval.
Music and Media Streaming:

-Playlists and Recommendations: Sorting is employed to create personalized playlists and suggest media content to users based on their preferences.

Data Analysis:

-Data Visualization: Sorting data for charts and graphs allows analysts to present information in an orderly and visually understandable manner.
